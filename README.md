# Kafka-Spark-HBase-Sentiment-Analysis
# Description
This project is an implementation of a Big data workflow. It aims to manipulate different big data technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark and Apache Hbase. This application consists of a (dumb) sentiment analysis of a twitter stream that is based on computing a score for each tweet. The score is calculated as follows: for each tweet text eliminate the (stop words) , add +1 for positive words and retrieve  -1 for n√©gative words.
The application is developed in Java 8.
The [Infrastructure] is based on docker. I used a docker compose file that launches Apache Kafka (a Kafka Broker), Apache Spark (a Driver container and 2 worker containers) and Apache Cassandra (Apache Cassandra container). More informations can be found in the [wurstmeister/kafka](https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka) repository at docker hub.
 


# Architecture

![Big data workflow](Architecture.jpg)

The architecture consists of an ingestion and processing of a stream of Tweets consumed from the twitter developer Account. The result is stored in a database for visualization and querying.

 # Prerequisite

* Install Java8: 
* Install docker: you can use this script https://get.docker.com/
